            We Billy Boppin Bloggers, a company that has a very refined taste, in that we only listen to music where the artist's name contains the word "Billy" or something that sounds close enough. We also only listen to BOPS. We are a team made up of Lily Phan, Mona Afshar, Alisa Wu, and Damilola-Oluwa Adeniyi. Come on our journey as we listen and disect the music of all the talented Billy's around the world. The only way to see the true talent in the Billy's is by comparing them to the ultimate Bill, Bill gates. This is why we rate them out of 5 Bill Gates. 5 being the ultimate score of just as successful as Bill Gates and 1 being incomparable to Bill Gates.

            Song Choice: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wccRif2DaGs" target = "_blank">Vienna</a><br><br>
            When listening to Billy Joel's Vienna, you are taken through quite the journey. It's almost as if you forget about the autotune of the 21st century and really listen to the skill in his voice.<br><br>
            The passion in his voice shows the raw emotion he puts into his art form. Don't even get me started on the instrumental part of the song; truly an experience. I wish I could go back to the first time I heard this song.

            Billie highlights in this song how one feels when they are away from a person that seems to always bring them down. Sh expresses the breath of fresh air that's felt as a result of detachment from that certain individual. It's a really heartfelt and expressive song that I think we'll all relate to at least once in our love lives or even outside that scope.

            <br><br>
            Although Billy Ray Cyrus is mostly known for the widespread fame of his daughter, Miley Cyrus his hard work and passion in music shine through in his work. Listening to knock you out takes you through quite the experience. Although the lyrics are found to be  repetitive, the upbeat background music really pumps you up. This song is great for hyping you  up a workout for putting you in the mood to go out.
